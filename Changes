        Use CGI::Test for the test suite.

        Always use "sub { … }" around default values. (Needed to
        support Moo ≤ 1.000008.)

        Fix isa test for log: The log doesn't need to exist in
        advance, but the directory it will be in needs to exist.

        Skip t/basic-functionality.t under dos-ish operating systems
        as it contains Bourne shell code.

        Add Shields.io based passed/failed/errored badges and hooks to
        put the according one into a deployment directory.

        Also verify a failed authentication case in t/methods.t.
