An easy to use module for writing CGI-based
[Github webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) backends in
Perl.

In most cases three statements already suffice. Configure a script to
trigger, a shared secret and a log file and you're ready to go.

It also supports updating [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)-like
status badges depending on the trigger script's return code (or fork
success/fail).

Synopsis
--------

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI::Github::Webhook;

my $ghwh = CGI::Github::Webhook->new(
    mime_type => 'text/plain',
    trigger => '/srv/some-github-project/bin/deploy.pl',
    trigger_backgrounded => 1,
    secret => 'use a generated password here, nothing valuable',
    log => '/srv/some-github-project/log/deployment.log',
    badge_to => '/srv/some-github-project/htdocs/status.svg',
);
$ghwh->run();
```

Motivation
----------

The module has been written over the frustration of not getting
[GitHub::WebHook](https://metacpan.org/release/GitHub-WebHook) to work
together with [CGI.pm](https://metacpan.org/release/CGI).

It's first incarnation has been written as single CGI script powering
a webhook for the
[Debian Package Management Book](http://www.dpmb.org/) to trigger
builds of the e-book variants and their deployment upon every push.
